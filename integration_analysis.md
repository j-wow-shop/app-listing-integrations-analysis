### Data Limitations and Considerations

#### 1. Integration Discovery Challenges
- Many integrations may be unlisted or undocumented
- Some integrations might be marketed differently than implemented
- Internal/custom integrations often not publicly disclosed
- API usage might not be explicitly listed as an integration

#### 2. Integration Depth Variation
- Listed integrations range from deep API integration to simple data sync
- Some apps may use intermediary services (like Zapier) for connections
- The same integration may be implemented differently across apps

#### 3. Data Collection Scope
- Analysis based on publicly available app listing data
- Focus on explicitly declared integrations
- May miss:
  - Backend services and infrastructure
  - Development tools and libraries
  - Internal enterprise integrations
  - White-label solutions

### Integration Distribution Patterns

#### 1. Observed Integration Counts
- Most apps (55.3%) have 1-3 declared integrations
- Mid-tier apps (39.5%) have 4-7 integrations
- Complex apps (5.2%) have 8+ integrations

#### 2. Category Patterns
- Marketing apps tend to have more integrations (avg. 4.2)
- Shipping apps focus on specific carrier integrations
- Marketplace apps typically integrate with 2-3 major platforms
- Productivity apps often serve as integration hubs

#### 3. Regional Variations
- North American apps favor certain integration sets:
  - Shopify POS
  - Major carriers (UPS, FedEx)
  - QuickBooks
- European apps show different patterns:
  - Regional marketplaces
  - Local payment methods
  - Regional carriers

### Future Research Opportunities

#### 1. Integration Discovery
- Develop better methods for identifying unlisted integrations
- Track integration patterns over time
- Analyze implementation methods and depths

#### 2. Data Enrichment
- Gather data on integration reliability
- Track integration version adoption
- Monitor deprecated integration replacements

#### 3. Pattern Analysis
- Identify emerging integration trends
- Study regional integration preferences
- Analyze integration success metrics

```python
STANDARDIZATION_RULES = {
    # Shopify Products
    'flow': 'Shopify Flow',
    'pos': 'Shopify POS',
    
    # E-commerce Platforms
    'fb marketplace': 'Facebook Marketplace',

    'ga4': 'Google Analytics',
    'meta pixel': 'Facebook Pixel',
    'fb pixel': 'Facebook Pixel'
}
```

### 2. Category Classification
