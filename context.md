# Shopify App Integration Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the Shopify app ecosystem, specifically focusing on understanding and standardizing the integrations that different apps offer. The end goal is to create a structured and standardized list of integrations across the app ecosystem.

## Data Source Investigation
Initial investigation shows:
1. We have access to app data through `shopify-dw.apps_and_developers.public_apps`
2. The integration information is not directly available in the data warehouse tables
3. We will need to scrape this information from the public app store pages

## Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Data Collection
1. Query top 100 published apps from data warehouse using `apps_and_developers.public_apps`
2. Use app_store_url or construct URLs for each app
3. Create a scraper to extract integration information from each app's page
4. Store results in a local CSV with:
   - App name
   - App URL
   - Integration names
   - App rating/review count

Phase 2: Data Analysis
1. Use GPT-4o via Shopify's internal proxy to:
   - Clean and standardize integration names
   - Identify common patterns and categories
   - Create a hierarchical taxonomy of integrations
   - Handle edge cases and variations in naming
   - Suggest standardized naming conventions

Phase 3: Documentation
1. Document the standardized taxonomy
2. Record patterns and naming conventions
3. Note any special cases or exceptions
4. Provide recommendations for future integration categorization

## Technical Implementation
1. Python script using:
   - BigQuery for initial app data
   - Requests/BeautifulSoup for web scraping
   - Pandas for data manipulation
   - Shopify's GPT-4o proxy for analysis
   - CSV for data storage

## Manual Steps Required
1. Review and approve the initial 100 apps selected
2. Verify scraping results for accuracy
3. Review and validate GPT-4o's categorization
4. Final approval of standardized taxonomy

## Next Steps
1. Create initial Python script structure
2. Query and extract top 100 apps
3. Implement web scraping component
4. Set up GPT-4 proxy integration
5. Create analysis pipeline
